## Features

- Student registration and profile management
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data
- RESTful API implementation using Spring Boot
- Data persistence with Spring Data JPA (assumed; please update if using a different method)
- Input validation and error handling

## Technologies Used

- Java (100%)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA (if applicable)
- Maven or Gradle (for build management)
- MySQL (for persistence, if applicable)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NisanthV/Spring-Student.git
   cd Spring-Student
   ```

2. **Configure the database**
   - Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your database credentials.

3. **Build and run the application**
   - Using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

## Usage

- By default, the application will run on `http://localhost:8080/`.
- Use API tools like Postman or curl to interact with the REST endpoints.
